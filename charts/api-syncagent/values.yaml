# Required: You need to configure a reference to an APIExportEndpointSlice so the
# agent knows which API to serve and where to connect to. For kcp 0.27, you can
# also instead configure an APIExport, but this is not recommended and could cause
# issues when upgrading kcp.

# Alternatively: the name of the APIExport in kcp that this Sync Agent is supposed
# to serve. Configuring an APIExportEndpointSlice instead is recommended and
# futureproof.
# apiExportName: ""

# This Agent's public name, purely for informational purposes. If not set, defaults
# to the Helm release name.
agentName: ""

# Required: Name of the Kubernetes Secret that contains a "kubeconfig" key,
# with the kubeconfig provided by kcp to access it. This kubeconfig must point
# directly to the kcp cluster where the referenced object above
# (APIExportEndpointSlice or APIExport) exist.
kcpKubeconfig: ""

# Optional: Name of a Kubernetes Secret that contains a "kubeconfig" key,
# with a kubeconfig to access the service cluster (in case the agent is
# running on a cluster that is not the target cluster for the API sync).
kubeconfig: ""

# Optional: Override the host configured in the local kubeconfig.

# Optional: Override the server CA file configured in the local kubeconfig

# Optional: If two or more SyncAgents are installed into the same namespace,
# each one must have a Kubernetes label selector to scope down which
# PublishedResources (PRs) they process, as no two agents must process the same.
# If just one Sync Agent is installed in the cluster, this can be left blank, but
# still be used to ignore certain PRs if desired.
