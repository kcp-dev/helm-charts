            PublishedResource describes how an API type (usually defined by a CRD)
            on the service cluster should be exposed in kcp workspaces. Besides
            controlling how namespaced and cluster-wide resources should be mapped,
            the GVK can also be transformed to provide a uniform, implementation-independent
            access to the APIs inside kcp.
