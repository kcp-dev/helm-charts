            PublishedResource describes how an API type (usually defined by a CRD)
            on the service cluster should be exposed in kcp workspaces. Besides
            controlling how namespaced and cluster-wide resources should be mapped,
            the GVK can also be transformed to provide a uniform, implementation-independent
            access to the APIs inside kcp.

                    Naming can be used to control how the namespace and names for local objects
                    are formed. If not specified, the Sync Agent will use defensive defaults to
                    prevent naming collisions in the service cluster.
                    When configuring this, great care must be taken to not allow for naming
                    collisions to happen; keep in mind that the same name/namespace can exists in
                    many different kcp workspaces.

                        This guarantees unique names as long as the cluster name is used for the local namespace
                        (the default unless configured otherwise).

                        This value is a Go template, see the documentation for the available variables and functions.

                        Alternatively (but deprecated), this value can be a simple string using one of the following
                        placeholders:

                          - $remoteClusterName   -- the kcp workspace's cluster name (e.g. "1084s8ceexsehjm2")
                          - $remoteNamespace     -- the original namespace used by the consumer inside the kcp
                                                    workspace (if targetNamespace is left empty, it's equivalent
                                                    to setting "$remote_ns")
                          - $remoteNamespaceHash -- first 20 hex characters of the SHA-1 hash of $remoteNamespace
                          - $remoteName          -- the original name of the object inside the kcp workspace
                                                    (rarely used to construct local namespace names)
                          - $remoteNameHash      -- first 20 hex characters of the SHA-1 hash of $remoteName

                        Authors are advised to use Go templates instead, as the custom variable syntax is deprecated
                        and will be removed from a future release of the Sync Agent.

                      description: |-
                        For namespaced resources, the this field allows to control where the local objects will
                        be created. If left empty, "{{ .ClusterName }}" is assumed.

                        This value is a Go template, see the documentation for the available variables and functions.

                        Alternatively (but deprecated), this value can be a simple string using one of the following
                        placeholders:

                          - $remoteClusterName   -- the kcp workspace's cluster name (e.g. "1084s8ceexsehjm2")
                          - $remoteNamespace     -- the original namespace used by the consumer inside the kcp
                                                    workspace (if targetNamespace is left empty, it's equivalent
                                                    to setting "$remote_ns")
                          - $remoteNamespaceHash -- first 20 hex characters of the SHA-1 hash of $remoteNamespace
                          - $remoteName          -- the original name of the object inside the kcp workspace
                                                    (rarely used to construct local namespace names)
                          - $remoteNameHash      -- first 20 hex characters of the SHA-1 hash of $remoteName

                        Authors are advised to use Go templates instead, as the custom variable syntax is deprecated
                        and will be removed from a future release of the Sync Agent.

                    Projection is used to change the GVK of a published resource within kcp.
                    This can be used to hide implementation details and provide a customized API
                    experience to the user.
                    All fields in the projection are optional. If a field is set, it will overwrite
                    that field in the GVK. The namespaced field can be set to turn a cluster-wide
                    resource namespaced or vice-versa.

                        the plural name will also be updated by taking the lowercased kind name and appending
                        an "s". If this would yield an undesirable name, use the plural field to explicitly
                        give the plural name.
