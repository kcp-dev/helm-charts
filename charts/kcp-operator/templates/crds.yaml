                            the certificate is no longer valid).

                            renew the certificate. For example, if a certificate is valid for 60 minutes,
                            and `renewBefore=10m`, cert-manager will begin to attempt to renew the certificate
                            50 minutes after it was issued (i.e. when there are 10 minutes remaining until
                            the certificate is no longer valid).

                            NOTE: The actual lifetime of the issued certificate is used to determine the
                            renewal time. If an issuer returns a certificate with a different lifetime than
                            the one requested, cert-manager will use the lifetime of the issued certificate.
